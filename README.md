# Employment-based Immigration Data Analysis

The purpose of this work is to analyse the perm data publically available for the year 2017 from the Department of Labor website: https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/oflc/pdfs/PERM_Disclosure_Data_FY17.xlsx

Via this work, I intend to analyse and classify the job categories of  perm applications submitted to the DOL. 

Secondary objective of this work is to classify the data based on two predominant nationality (Indians and Chinese) and all others as Rest of the World (ROW). 

Tertiary objective is to analyse which of the immigrants are financially more secure compared to the rest.
